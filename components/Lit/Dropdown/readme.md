This component accepts an array of items and a selected value as properties, and renders a select dropdown menu with options for each item. When the user selects a different option, the component dispatches a "selected" event with the new selected value as the event detail.

You can use this web component in your html file by defining the tag `<dropdown-menu>` and setting the properties `items` and `selected`.

```html
<tds-dropdown items=${items} selected=${selectedValue} @selected=${handleSelected}></tds-dropdown>
```

In the above example `items` is array of options and selectedValue is the current selected option. handleSelected is a function that will be called when the user select a new option.
